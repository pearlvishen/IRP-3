    <h2> Antanas, a month with you was not so bad. I would say that it was actually quite a long time. We should have moved earlier, but now it is too late. The Germans are here, and they know that we are too. The bullets will run out soon, and I do not know whether to save one for myself or to use the last one on the Germans. It's strange how we fight together when we know nothing about one another. But our fight has come to an end. <br>
    Maybe our mistakes were too great to overcome.  </h2>

Others will find out later, but for the time being we sit here across from one another and don't know where, when, or how we made that mistake"</i> (Meras 107). </h3>

    <h3>Here is an extremely realistic reenactment of what happened that fateful day.</h3>
