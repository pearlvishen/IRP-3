 "Schoger is clever, but he gave me too much time. . . Kasriel found a cellar no one else knew, bricked a hook into the cieling, and from thin strands wove a strong, thick rope" (Meras 89). 
         <br>
         <br>I don't want Schoger to cut off my fingers; I know I am not strong enough. I will tell him, father; I will tell him everything. Do you understand me, father? Why won't you just move the weapons. Perhaps this will be easier. I understand, Abraham. I understand what I must do. I must protect the secrets. I am ready, and I am comfortable. I wish you well, Abraham. I wish you well, my people. I see my future now.  <br>
